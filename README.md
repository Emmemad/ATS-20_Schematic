The schematic was traced back from original PCB by TB5CVN published [here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/SI4732_SSB_AM_FM_HAM_RADIO.html) and should correspond to products sold as *"ATS-20"* and to some Si4735/Si4732 DIY radio PCB kits.

Values of resistors and some other information was taken from PCB photos by Robert Richmond available [here](https://swling.com/blog/2021/05/si473x-receiver-firmware-update-and-internal-photos/)

Schematic is available as a [KiCAD 6.0 project](/ATS-20/ATS-20_TB5CVN_Trace) and also in [PDF](/ATS-20/ATS-20_Schematic.pdf).

[Pictures](/ATS-20/Pictures) folder contains original and upscaled versions of PCB layout pictures and also other board and unit photos

Unfortunately I do not have the device with me, so if you have one and can correct or add something - feel free to contact me or open an issue

Due to the fact that schematic was traced back from PCB pictures it **may contain errors**, so use this schematic **at your own risk**.

Also be aware that units you buy from chinese sellers can have all sorts of changes in PCB layout and schematics. 

You can get more information about the Si4735/Si4732 radios from PU2CLR's [Github page](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735)

## ATS-20+

ATS-20+ is a newer version of this device with some changes in schematic (most significant change is an addition of the FM filter and amplifier)

Schematic is available as a [KiCAD 6.0 project](/ATS-20/ATS-20_Plus_Trace) and also in [PDF](/ATS-20%2B/ATS-20_Plus_Schematic.pdf).
